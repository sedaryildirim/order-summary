## My process

Started with placing all html elements in corect divs, along with class ids to to move onto CSS
styling using flexbox.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to wrap text around a paragraph with word-wrap: break-word; 

.paragraph-text {
    width: 300px;
    word-wrap: break-word;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}

### Continued development

Need to improve on flexbox layout and aligning/resizing flexboxes
